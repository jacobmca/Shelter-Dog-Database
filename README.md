## Description

This is the Shelter Dog Finder, a search engine that allows users to sort through shelter dogs and favorite the ones you connect with most. Based on your favorites, the application will automatically match you with a shelter.

This repo primarily utilizes React, TypeScript, and Bootstrap.

npm i<br/>
npm run dev

Once you've logged in, the page will update to show two drop-down menus and an input field to help you sort through dog options. Use "Filter by Breed" to sort by breed, and "Sort Direction" to sort alphabetically in ascending or descending fashion by breed. The "Filter by City" field allows you to sort options based on specific city.

In the right hand corner of the navbar, click "See Your Match" to generate a shetler dog match! If you'd like to generate another, click "Generate New Match." If no dogs are favorited, this section will be empty.

## Tests
In the future, I would love to update this application to include more ways of sorting through the dogs - name, age, etc. I'd also love to update the user profiles to allow them to be personizable, with user information including name, location, and other information pertinent to the application's dog adoption focused subject matter.
