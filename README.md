Once you've logged in, the page will update to show two drop-down menus to help you sort through your dog options. Use "Filter by Breed" to sort by breed, and Sort Direction to sort alphabetically in ascending or descending fashion by breed.

In the right hand corner of the navbar, click "See Your Match" to generate a shetler dog match! If you'd like to generate another, click "Generate New Match." If no dogs are favorited, this section will be empty.

## Tests
In the future, I would love to update this application to include more ways of sorting through the dogs - name, age, etc. I'd also love to update the user profiles to allow them to be personizable, with user information including name, location, and other information pertinent to the application's dog adoption focused subject matter.
